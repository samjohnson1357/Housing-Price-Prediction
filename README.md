# Housing-Price-Prediction

For this project I use modern regression methods to predict housing prices and analyze the effects that different independant variables have on said housing prices. "AmesHousing.csv" is the original dataset and "EncodedAmesHousing.csv" is the dataset after some variable encoding has been performed. A thorough analysis of the dataset can be found in "Final Report.pdf". The SAS code can be found in the appendix of the final report.
